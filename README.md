For the first guide in the React Modules Component Guide followed Smari's tutorial about components and then added to it, changed and created more components. 
- Added Card and Navbar. 
- When you click the buttons they will log text in the console. 
- For fun I also added some CSS animation, hover and transform. 

Continued working in this Repo for React Module Props Guide. 
- Customized components with Props.
- Changed the Navbar and added links. 
- InfoCards Components use Props
- Button Components use Props
